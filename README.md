# kOS-MissionControl
This is a work in progress set of Mission Control protocols, 
libraries and utilities for Kerbal Space Program using kOS 
and RemoteTech.

These protocols will leverage content from other authors on 
Git and from the internet and they will be credited in the 
license file when possible, but for the purpose of conserving 
as much kOS disk space as possible, author comments will not 
be provided in msc refactored .ks files themselves.

//TODO: TOC for Protocol Files and Purpose

The goal of this project is to fabricate the infrastructure 
for a fully functional Mission Control platform to interact 
with and overlay the kOS interface. If the project becomes 
comprehensive enough, the final stage will be to produce a 
new Mission Control UI mod that will allow users to plan, 
execute and monitor hands-free manned and unmanned 
missions with little to no actual programming in kOS.

If successful, a subset of features are also planned to add 
additional support for RemoteTech with realistic handling of 
unmanned missions as well as metered feature governance in 
Career mode.
